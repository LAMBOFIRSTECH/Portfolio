| **📝 Description**   | This repository serves as a central showcase of my professional projects, built using microservices architecture, containerized environments, secure APIs, and CI/CD best practices. |
| **🎯 Objective Final** | The ultimate goal of the project is to deploy the application on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), making it directly accessible for users.                              |

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: C#, Bash, YAML, Python
- **Frameworks**: .NET 8 / .NET Core, Entity Framework Core
- **DevOps Tools**: SonarQube, Burp Suite, Docker, Docker Compose, GitLab CI, Trivy for non vulnerabilities docker images and Docker bench to secure docker container
- **Secrets & Security**: HashiCorp Vault(Secrets) , AppRole (each API need credentials to interact with Vault using AppRole), JWT (Asymetric algorithm)
- **Automation**: Ansible, Bash and python scripts, Git hooks
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetric, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Graylog
- **Auth & API Gateway**: Keycloak (IAM, Standard Ldap and SSO), Nginx, Traefik, Gravitee io
- **Databases**: SQL Server (On a windows server Machine 2019), PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Infrastructure**: Consul(For services discovery), Nomad (For orchestration), OpenLDAP, Redis

## ⚙️ Key Highlights

- Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design principles
- Fully containerized microservices, API-first approach + RabbitMq (For API notification)
- Dockerfile + docker-compose support for each project
- All our docker images are dowloading on DockerHub
- CI/CD-ready projects (with pipelines in GitLab CI or GitHub Actions)
- Secure API design (JWT, OAuth2, Vault-based secret injection)
- Scalable and modular backend systems

## 📌 About Me

I'm an Engineer specialized in DevOps and scalable backend systems.  
I've worked on real-world infrastructures at **ATOS** and **Meloaude**, where I led projects from development to containerized deployment with strong security and monitoring layers.

I believe in reliable delivery, transparency, and long-term system stability.  
📍 Currently open to full-time DevOps positions (Strasbourg or remote).
